          We have a (very) unofficial slogan here: more human than human.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          OK, sure, it's a line from the movie Blade Runner... a movie where,
          admittedly, things didn't end well in an AI-enhanced future. We found
          the film fascinating when we first saw it back in the 80s.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          If nothing else, the film and Thomas Pynchon's story "Do Androids
          Dream of Electric Sheep" (on which the film was based) have kept
          ruminations on the potential – and risks – of advanced technology on
          our minds.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          Yep, we've been thinking about this stuff since it was solely the
          provenance of sci-fi flicks. And that is quite a while.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          But we digresss. To us, the slogan means providing users with
          litigation-ready documents that could be drafted by practitioners at
          the profession's highest levels. (This is the “human” at the end of
          the motto.) But also, providing them with a speed and ease that far
          exceeds the capabilities of a human legal writer. (That's the “more
          human than” part.)
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          With this post, we explicate with greater particularity what that
          means.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          We recently spotted an article on The Register, an enterprise
          technology newsletter, that focused on a growing problem with AI
          content. Specifically, the problem of vacuous, low value “AI spam” and
          its negative effect on the Internet as a whole.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          In the article, Jon Gillham, founder and CEO of AI content detection
          platform Originality.ai, told The Register that “Google is losing its
          war on spammy, scammy content in its search results.”
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          Granted, as the founder of an "AI Gotcha" platform, Gillham's got skin
          in the game, but that doesn't make him wrong.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          In fact, his thesis has been echoed in other
          <a
            href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/google-search-is-losing-the-fight-with-seo-spam-study-says/"
          >
            respected publications.</a
          >
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          "Not all AI content is spam, but I think right now all spam is AI
          content." Gillham told The Register.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          That brings to mind a very old saying (the first recorded use dates
          back to 1957.) amongst software engineers: garbage in, garbage out. It
          means that, in computing, poor quality input will always produce
          faulty output. That is what we are beginning to see, and its what we
          believe will determine the winners and losers debuting this first wave
          of AI applications.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          At Novodraft, we believe that AI generative content is only as good as
          the human prompt (AI) engineers and gatekeepers that guide its
          creation and deployment. AI is not a “set it and forget it”
          proposition, one that can be "switched on”, enabling its owners to
          retire to a beach in the Caribbean and collect checks.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          Rather, the process that yields AI generative content depends on
          active management and intelligent, informed curation.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
          The most integral part of Novodraft are the human attorneys and
          engineers behind it. Attorneys with a track record of reliability,
          trial wins, and scholarly publication... who also happen to have
          software/systems engineering backgrounds. Their efforts are the input.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">It is what sets Novodraft apart.</p>
        <p class="body-text">
          Demonstrating this belief is one of the purposes of this blog. We
          challenge you to spot a post that is AI-generated, versus one written
          by our staff. In the future, we'll offer incentives for doing so
          successfully.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          In the meantime, we challenge you to spot an "all AI" post. If you
          think you have one,
          <a href="mailto:no-one@snai1mai1.com?subject=ai content"
            >let us know.</a
          >
          If you're right, we will tell you so, point-blank, without hesitation.
          And you'll know whether you can rely on Novodraft to be more human
          than human.
