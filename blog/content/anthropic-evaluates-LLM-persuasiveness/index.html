          Anthropic's New Framework to Evaluate AI
          Persuasiveness
        </h1>

          Anthropic, an AI research organization, has developed a method to test
          how persuasive language models (LMs) are. In order to engage with the
          safety issues of large models, the team at Anthropic aims to make them
          more reliable and improve their safe deployment. This study on model
          persuasiveness forms part of that initiative.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          The research involved the development of a quantitative framework to
          evaluate opinions model-generated responses express. The aim was to
          understand the persuasiveness of different versions of AI models, an
          attribute that has not been extensively studied before. The study
          found that larger, newer AI models tended to be more persuasive, a
          finding with significant implications as LMs continue to evolve.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          The research conlcuded that, as technology evolves and models are
          further refined, there's a likelihood of increased persuasiveness.
          This factor is vital to consider in the development and deployment of
          AI models as their impact on society and behaviour will be
          substantial.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          The team also conducted an in-house persuasion test. While the
          effectiveness of this test at measuring true persuasiveness may be
          questioned due to inherent bias, it forms an integral part of the
          research. The researchers claimed to gain deeper insight into the
          nuances of persuasiveness in AI models and provided a basis for
          further studies on this subject.
        </p>
        <p class="body-text">
          The research sheds light on the persuasiveness of AI models and may
          serve as incentive for future studies on AI safety and reliability. By
          introducing a method to measure persuasiveness, the research hopes to
          aid the AI community understand the implications of model
          persuasiveness.
