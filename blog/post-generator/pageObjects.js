      "Anthropic's New Framework to Quantitatively Evaluate AI Model Persuasiveness",
    content:
      "Anthropic, an AI research organization, has developed a method to test how persuasive language models (LMs) are. In order to engage with the safety issues of large models, the team at Anthropic aims to make them more reliable and improve their safe deployment. This study on model persuasiveness forms part of that initiative. \n The research involved the development of a quantitative framework to evaluate whose opinions model-generated responses are more similar to. The aim was to understand the persuasiveness of different versions of AI models, an aspect that has not been extensively studied before. The study found that larger, newer AI models tended to be more persuasive, a finding with significant implications as LMs continue to evolve.  \n It was also discovered that as technology develops and models are further refined, there's a chance of increased persuasiveness. This factor is vital to consider in the development and deployment of AI models as their impact on society and behaviour could be substantial. \n  In addition to this, the team also conducted an in-house persuasion test. While the effectiveness of this test at measuring true persuasiveness may be questioned, it forms a crucial part of the research. The test's results helped the team understand the nuances of persuasiveness in AI models and provided a basis for further studies on this subject. \n Anthropic has shared these findings in order to contribute to the understanding and improvement of language model behaviours. The research not only sheds light on the persuasiveness of AI models but also paves the way for future studies on AI safety and reliability. \n The study by Anthropic offers a new perspective on the capabilities of AI models. By introducing a method to measure persuasiveness, the research helps the AI community understand the implications of model persuasiveness and how it can be harnessed for better AI safety and deployment.\n The full article may be viewed here: https://www.anthropic.com/research/measuring-model-persuasiveness?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email",

      "Colorado's State of Mind: Groundbreaking Neurological Data Protection",
    title: "Brain Data Privacy",
    content:
      "In a historic first, the state of Colorado has taken a bold step towards the future of privacy rights in the digital era. A new law has been signed into action by Governor Jared Polis, extending privacy rights to a realm hitherto untouched: neural data. \n The legislation, H.B. 24-1058, incorporates data generated by activity in the human nervous system into the personal information protected by Colorado's existing consumer privacy law. This marks a significant milestone in the evolution of privacy rights, acknowledging the increasing relevance of brain-computer interfaces and neurotechnology into mainstream society. \n Companies such as Elon Musk’s Neuralink are rapidly developing brain-computer interfaces, with the stated goal of changing lives for the better through pioneering healthcare uses.  The company envisions its devices being used to control prosthetics, restoring movement in individuals with paralysis or amputations. The technology potentially may open doors to human enhancement through memory augmentation and enhanced cognitive abilities.  On the downside, when our thoughts become digital data, they may be misused in a similar manner that conventional digital data has been. For example, exposure of highly sensitive personal information to the public, or even using the implanted devices to control individuals or influence their decision-making. The Colorado legislation sends a powerful message about the importance of proactive data protection, and reflects a deep understanding of the implications of rapidly advancing technology and the potential vulnerabilities it can create in the fabric of our privacy. \n\nThe law sets a precedent for other states, and in less than 24-hours since its passage, it is catalyzing a global conversation about the need for neuro-rights in an increasingly digital world. This move by Colorado not only expands the scope of what personal data protection means but also paves the way for a future where our most intimate data generated by our own brains - in essence our thoughts - are safeguarded against misuse. \n\nIt is a step towards a future where the rights of the individual extend to all aspects of personal data, even that which is generated by our own brains and nervous systems. The implications of this law will undoubtedly be closely watched by privacy advocates, technology companies, and lawmakers.",
